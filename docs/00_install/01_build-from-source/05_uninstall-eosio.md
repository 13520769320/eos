If you need to uninstall the EOSIO software, for instance to install prebuilt binaries or to build from source again, you can run the `eosio_uninstall.sh` script within the `eos/scripts` folder:

```sh
$ cd ~/eosio/eos
$ sudo ./scripts/eosio_uninstall.sh
```

The script will prompt the user to optionally uninstall EOSIO dependencies. This is recommended if installing the EOSIO binaries or building EOSIO for the first time.
